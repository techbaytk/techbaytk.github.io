Windows File Explorer has been the default file management tool for millions of users for decades. While it is a reliable and familiar tool, it lacks many modern features that power users need.  

Over the years, Microsoft has added some improvements, such as dark mode and tabbed browsing, but many essential tools are still missing. After years of struggling with these limitations, I discovered **OneCommander**, a third-party file manager that solved all my file management problems. In this article, I‚Äôll share why I made the switch and how OneCommander addressed all my frustrations with File Explorer.  

## Why I Left Windows File Explorer  

### Lack of Essential Features  

Despite its longevity, Windows File Explorer lags behind in several key areas:  

1. **No folder sizes by default** ‚Äì Microsoft claims this is due to performance issues.  
2. **No dual-pane browsing** ‚Äì Comparing files or moving them between folders is cumbersome.  
3. **Limited customization** ‚Äì Users can‚Äôt deeply customize the interface or behavior.  
4. **No quick file age preview** ‚Äì It‚Äôs hard to tell when a file was last modified without opening its properties.  

These shortcomings make managing large amounts of data inefficient and frustrating. While temporary fixes exist (like using Windhawk to display folder sizes), they are often clunky and unsupported.  

### Performance and Support Issues  

File Explorer doesn‚Äôt always run smoothly on low-spec devices, and since it‚Äôs built into Windows, there‚Äôs no dedicated support team to address user feedback or quickly fix bugs. Third-party tools like OneCommander, however, are often developed by passionate developers or small teams that actively respond to user needs.  

## What Makes OneCommander Special?  

After trying several alternatives‚Äîincluding feature-rich but expensive options like File Pilot‚ÄîI settled on **OneCommander**, a free, fast, and highly customizable file manager that delivers everything I wanted from File Explorer.  

### Fast Performance and Modern Interface  

OneCommander launches faster than File Explorer and uses fewer system resources. It consumes only **2% CPU on startup** (compared to File Explorer‚Äôs 5%), making it ideal for older machines. Its sleek, responsive interface feels more modern and polished than File Explorer‚Äôs dated design.

### Folder Sizes Displayed by Default  

Unlike File Explorer, **OneCommander shows folder sizes by default**, eliminating the need for external add-ons or workarounds.

### Dual-Pane Browsing for Efficient File Management  

OneCommander offers **two types of dual-pane layouts**:  

- **Standard Dual-Pane** ‚Äì Displays folders side by side for easy comparison.

- **Column Dual-Pane** ‚Äì Navigates using a Mac Finder-like column view.

The standard dual-pane layout is especially useful for transferring files between folders or comparing their contents.  

### Smart File Age Indicators  

Instead of raw dates, OneCommander displays file ages **relatively** (e.g., "3 days ago") and uses color-coded tags to indicate recency. This makes it easy to spot recently modified files at a glance.

### Advanced Organization & Customization Tools  

1. **Add notes** ‚Äì Attach notes inside folders for reminders.  
2. **Color tagging** ‚Äì Assign one of seven colors to folders for visual organization.  
3. **Color-based search** ‚Äì Filter files and folders by their assigned colors.  

These features make navigating folders with hundreds (or thousands) of items much easier.

### Automated File Processing  

OneCommander includes a **File Processor** with built-in templates for batch renaming and metadata fixes (e.g., MP3 song titles). While advanced features like video-to-MP4 conversion require a **$25 Pro license**, the free version still offers powerful automation tools.

### Extensive Customization Options  

From themes and icons to font sizes and animations, OneCommander gives users **full control** over their experience. These settings are neatly organized in the app‚Äôs configuration menu.

## How to Set OneCommander as Your Default File Manager  

OneCommander allows you to set it as the **default file manager** directly from its settings. You can even bind it to the **Win+E shortcut**, just like File Explorer.

This level of integration is rare among third-party file managers, ensuring a seamless transition away from File Explorer.  

### Final Thoughts  

Using OneCommander has completely transformed how I manage my files. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and packed with features Microsoft still hasn‚Äôt added to File Explorer. Whether you‚Äôre frustrated by missing folder sizes, lack of customization, or sluggish performance, **OneCommander is a compelling alternative**.  

If you‚Äôre looking for a smarter, more efficient way to manage files on Windows, give **OneCommander a try**. The best part? It‚Äôs completely free.
