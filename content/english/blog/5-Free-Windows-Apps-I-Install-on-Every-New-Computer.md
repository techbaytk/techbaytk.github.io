That new computer smell is intoxicating, isn't it? The sleek design, the promise of speed... until you power it on and realize it's bloated with pre-installed software you'll never use and lacking essential tools to make your digital life smoother. After years of this cycle, I've developed a core set of must-have free Windows apps that instantly make any new machine feel like my own. Without these, my PC feels incomplete.  

If you're setting up a new Windows computer, here are the first five apps I always download:  

## 1. IObit Uninstaller  

One of my first tasks with a fresh Windows install is tackling unwanted bloatware—those unnecessary apps manufacturers (or even Windows itself) pre-install. Manually removing them is tedious, which is why I rely on **IObit Uninstaller**. This utility lists all installed programs clearly, letting you check boxes next to unwanted apps and click "Uninstall."  

But IObit isn't just for initial cleanup—it's essential for ongoing maintenance. It helps:  
✔ Remove **bundled software** (those sneaky apps installed alongside others)  
✔ Uninstall large or rarely used programs to **reclaim disk space**  
✔ Manage and remove **browser extensions** from one interface  
✔ Clean leftover files after uninstalling  
✔ Update outdated software  
✔ Block annoying pop-up notifications  

It's a comprehensive system tool that keeps your PC lean and clean.

## 2. Everything  

Windows' built-in search has always frustrated me—it's slow and often fails to find files I know exist. **Everything** solves this perfectly. It delivers **lightning-fast file searches**, filtering results instantly as you type. You can:  
🔍 Exclude specific folders from searches  
📌 Bookmark frequent search queries  
🎯 Use advanced filters and operators  
📄 Even search for text inside files  

If you rely on Windows' default search, switching to Everything will feel revolutionary.

## 3. Screenpresso  

While Windows' Snipping Tool has its uses, **Screenpresso** is my go-to for efficient screenshots and annotations. It lets you capture:  
🖥️ Full screens  
🪟 Specific windows  
📏 Custom regions  
🌐 Scrolling web pages  

Its built-in editor saves me tons of time when creating tutorials or documenting issues. I can easily add arrows, numbered steps, text boxes, and blur sensitive info. Every screenshot auto-saves to a history log for quick retrieval later.  

Sharing is seamless too—upload directly to Google Drive, Dropbox, or email with one click.

## 4. Brave Browser  

Though Microsoft Edge has improved, **Brave** remains my daily browser for its **privacy-first approach**:  
🛡️ Blocks ads & trackers by default  
🔒 Strong protection against cookies and fingerprinting  
🌐 Includes Tor private windows for extra anonymity  
💰 Built-in crypto wallet and VPN options  

You get faster page loads and enhanced security without installing separate ad blockers or privacy extensions.

## 5. VLC Media Player  

No Windows setup is complete without **VLC**. This powerhouse plays virtually any media format flawlessly—from common MP4s to obscure FLAC and MKV files. Bonus features include:  
🎬 Screen and webcam recording  
📝 Manual subtitle syncing  
🔄 File format conversion  
🎨 Custom skins and interfaces  

Best of all, it's completely **ad-free and open-source**.
