With the launch of One UI 7, millions of Samsung fans are experiencing the vertical app drawer for the first timeâ€”a feature other Android phones have had for nearly a decade. Yet this simple change has become one of the most praised aspects of the update. Should you make the switch?  

Letâ€™s explore why this new layout might convince you to abandon the traditional horizontal app drawer if you havenâ€™t already.  

## Fewer Swipes to Reach Your Favorite Apps  

We unlock our phones hundreds of times a day. While we might not open the app drawer every time, doing so becomes significantly faster with a vertical layout.  

With horizontal app pages, accessing most apps requires multiple swipesâ€”apps on the first page are quick to reach, but those on later pages demand extra effort. The more apps you install, the longer it takes to reach those at the end. (Ever tried finding an app in a drawer with *nine* pages of apps?)  

A **vertical app drawer** changes everything. Every app is just **two gestures away**:  
1. Swipe up to open the drawer.  
2. Scroll vertically to your desired app.  

Thanks to **inertial scrolling**, icons move as fast as you flick your thumb. After a few uses, muscle memory kicks in, making navigation effortless.  

## Instant Alphabetical Navigation  

Fast scrolling is only part of the story. Like **Niagara Launcher** (a fan-favorite vertical launcher), Samsungâ€™s new drawer lets you **jump to any letter** in the alphabet.  

Simply **drag your thumb slowly** along the side of the screenâ€”as you hover over a letter, the app list instantly snaps to that section. No more guessing which page an app is on!  

## Vertical Scrolling Feels More Natural  

Personally, I find **vertical thumb movement** far more comfortable than horizontal swiping. Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€”sideways gestures (like Androidâ€™s back swipe) arenâ€™t painful, but repetitive horizontal scrolling feels awkward.  

This is why I prefer **vertical scrolling** in e-readers over page-turning animations. Decades ago, websites experimented with horizontal layouts, but vertical scrolling won. Weâ€™re all trained for it. So why should app drawers be any different?  

## A Seamless Extension of Your Home Screen  

The vertical drawer isnâ€™t just intuitiveâ€”it **extends your home screenâ€™s natural motion**. Swipe up to see your docked apps, then **continue the same gesture** to reveal the full app list. No jarring transitions.  

This refinement is so satisfying that itâ€™s one of the reasons Iâ€™ve stuck with **Samsungâ€™s One UI** over third-party launchers.  

### Final Thoughts  

Samsungâ€™s vertical app drawer is a **small change with big usability benefits**:  
âœ… **Faster access** to all apps  
âœ… **Alphabetical jumping** for precision  
âœ… **Ergonomic scrolling** that feels natural
