If you're preparing for a networking, Linux administration, DevOps, or cybersecurity job interview, understanding network ports is crucial. Port numbers are fundamental to network communications, and interviewers frequently test candidates on common ports, their associated protocols, and the security implications of open ports.

This guide covers **25 critical network ports** you should master. We'll explain their purpose, related protocols, and why they matter in technical interviews. Whether you're a beginner or a professional brushing up on fundamentals, this structured reference will help you confidently navigate port-related questions.

## **What Are Network Ports?**

Before diving into our list, let's clarify what a **network port** is.

A port is a **virtual channel** enabling communication between computers. Think of it like a hotel room number:

* The **IP address** is the hotel's street address  
* The **port number** specifies which service/application should receive the network request  

Ports fall into three main ranges:  
âœ… **0-1023** â†’ Well-known ports (used by system services)  
âœ… **1024-49151** â†’ Registered ports (used by applications)  
âœ… **49152-65535** â†’ Dynamic/private ports (temporary connections)  

Knowing key ports and their services is essential for troubleshooting, security management, and network optimization.

## **Why Interviewers Ask About Ports**

Port-related questions assess your understanding of:  
âœ… Services running on different ports  
âœ… Differences between TCP and UDP protocols  
âœ… Network troubleshooting methodologies  
âœ… Security risks of open ports  

Common interview questions include:  
* *Which port does SSH use?*  
* *How would you check open ports on Linux?*  
* *What's the difference between ports 80 and 443?*

## **Top 25 Network Ports to Memorize**

Here's the definitive list of **25 essential ports** with their protocols and purposes:

| **Port** | **Protocol** | **Service** | **Purpose** |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **20** | TCP | FTP (Data) | File transfers (active mode) |
| **21** | TCP | FTP (Control) | FTP command channel |
| **22** | TCP | SSH | Secure remote access/file transfer |
| **23** | TCP | Telnet | Unsecure remote login (legacy) |
| **25** | TCP | SMTP | Email sending |
| **53** | TCP/UDP | DNS | Domain name resolution |
| **67** | UDP | DHCP Server | IP address assignment |
| **68** | UDP | DHCP Client | Receives network configuration |
| **80** | TCP | HTTP | Unencrypted web traffic |
| **110** | TCP | POP3 | Legacy email retrieval |
| **123** | UDP | NTP | Network time synchronization |
| **135** | TCP | RPC | Windows service communication |
| **137** | UDP | NetBIOS | Windows name resolution |
| **138** | UDP | NetBIOS | Network browsing (Windows) |
| **139** | TCP | NetBIOS | Legacy Windows file sharing |
| **143** | TCP | IMAP | Modern email retrieval |
| **161** | UDP | SNMP | Network device monitoring |
| **389** | TCP/UDP | LDAP | Centralized authentication |
| **443** | TCP | HTTPS | Encrypted web traffic |
| **445** | TCP | SMB | Modern Windows file sharing |
| **465** | TCP | SMTPS | Secure email (legacy) |
| **514** | UDP | Syslog | Centralized logging |
| **993** | TCP | IMAPS | Secure IMAP |
| **995** | TCP | POP3S | Secure POP3 |
| **3306** | TCP | MySQL | Database service |
| **5432** | TCP | PostgreSQL | Open-source database |
| **5900** | TCP | VNC | Remote desktop access |
| **6379** | TCP | Redis | In-memory data store |
| **8080** | TCP | HTTP Alt | Application servers |
| **8443** | TCP | HTTPS Alt | Custom web apps |

ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tip:** Prioritize memorizing:  
âœ… **20/21 for FTP**  
âœ… **22 for SSH**  
âœ… **80 for HTTP**  
âœ… **443 for HTTPS**

## **How to Check Open Ports in Linux**

Use these three methods to identify open ports:

### **1\. Using ss (Modern & Fast)**
```bash
sudo ss -tulpn
```
ðŸ“Œ **Flags Explained:**  
- `-t`: Show TCP ports  
- `-u`: Show UDP ports  
- `-l`: List listening ports only  
- `-p`: Display process using port  
- `-n`: Show numeric port numbers  

---

### **2\. Using netstat (Legacy Tool)**
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn
```
ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Older systems may require this instead of `ss`.

---

### **3\. Port Scanning with nmap**
```bash
nmap -sT localhost
```
ðŸ“Œ **Flags Explained:**  
- `-sT`: TCP connect scan  
- `localhost`: Scan local machine

## **Security Best Practices**

Open ports create attack surfaces. Secure your system with:

âœ… **Close unused ports** - Disable unnecessary services  
âœ… **Implement firewalls** - Use `ufw` or `firewalld` to restrict access  
âœ… **Harden exposed services** - Enforce encryption for SSH/HTTPS  

Example: Block **Port 23 (Telnet)** using `ufw`:
```bash
sudo ufw deny 23
```
Or with `firewalld`:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=23/tcp --permanent
```
