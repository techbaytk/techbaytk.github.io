Have you ever tried to shut down or restart your **Windows 11** PC, only to return and find it still running with an error message saying **"This app is preventing shutdown"**? If you've encountered this frustrating situation, you're not alone.

This occurs because **Windows 11 includes a security feature** that blocks shutdown when there are open apps with unsaved data. While designed to prevent data loss, this behavior proves **annoying** for many usersâ€”especially when there's nothing important that actually needs saving.

In this guide, we'll explain **why this error happens** and show you **an easy way to bypass this behavior**, allowing you to **shut down your PC without manual intervention**.

## Why Does Windows 11 Block Shutdown?

When attempting to shut down, **Windows 11** scans all open apps to check for unsaved data. If it detects any application that hasn't fully closed, it halts the shutdown process and displays:  
**"This app is preventing shutdown."**

Even if you don't have any files open that need saving, this message may appear due to:

* **Unknown background processes** like `MKSInvisibleWindow`
* **Apps running that don't require saving** (e.g., Notepad)
* **System services** that haven't fully terminated

In these cases, you must either **close the app manually** or click **"Shut down anyway"** to force Windows 11 to complete the shutdown.

## How to Stop Apps from Blocking Windows 11 Shutdown

To fix this, you can **make a simple Registry tweak** that forces Windows to **automatically close apps** during shutdown.

### Step 1: Open Registry Editor (Regedit)

1. Press the **Search button** on the taskbar and type `regedit`.
2. Open **Registry Editor** and click **"Yes"** when prompted for admin access.

### **Step 2: Modify Registry Settings**

1. Navigate to this path:

       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop

2. In the right panel, **create a new String Value named `AutoEndTasks`** (if it doesn't already exist):
   * Right-click â†’ **New â†’ String Value**.
   * Rename the new value to `AutoEndTasks`.

**Set AutoEndTasks to 1**:

### **Step 3: Speed Up Shutdown**

To make shutdown **faster and more efficient**, add these values under the same path:

* **WaitToKillAppTimeout** â†’ Set to **2000** (2 seconds instead of 20).
* **HungAppTimeout** â†’ Reduce from **5000** to **2000**.

### **Step 4: Adjust System Settings**

1. Navigate to:

       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control

2. Find **WaitToKillServiceTimeout**.
3. **Set it to 2000** (instead of 5000).

### **Step 5: Apply Changes**

1. **Close Registry Editor**.
2. **Restart your PC** for the changes to take effect.

With these tweaks, **Windows 11 will shut down automatically** without requiring manual input. However, **always save your work before shutting down**, as the system will no longer check for unsaved data before closing apps.
