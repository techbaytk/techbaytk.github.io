  "content":"In today\u0026rsquo;s digital landscape, understanding online privacy tools has never been more crucial. Among these tools, proxy servers stand out as both useful and misunderstood. Let\u0026rsquo;s demystify what proxies are, how they work, and when they\u0026rsquo;re the right choice.\nHow Proxy Servers Work Normally, your internet traffic flows directly between your device and websites through various physical servers that make up the internet. This connection is transparent - both ends can see each other, and the data path can be traced (try tracert on Windows or traceroute on Linux/Mac to see this).\nWhen you use a proxy server, it acts as an intermediary. Any website you visit will see the proxy\u0026rsquo;s IP address rather than your real one. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re in Riyadh connecting through a London proxy, websites will think you\u0026rsquo;re accessing them from London.\nYou can configure proxies to:\nRoute all your traffic Only handle specific applications Work at system or browser level Beyond Privacy: Other Proxy Uses Proxies serve important functions in corporate and educational environments:\nFirewalling \u0026amp; Content Filtering: Many organizations use proxies to block restricted content or limit bandwidth usage Caching: Frequently accessed resources (like web pages) can be stored locally to save bandwidth and improve speed Load Balancing: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers When Should You Use a Proxy? While proxies provide basic IP masking, they don\u0026rsquo;t offer complete anonymity. They\u0026rsquo;re best suited for:\n‚úÖ Bypassing geo-restrictions (accessing region-locked videos/content)\n‚úÖ Circumventing IP-based voting limits\n‚úÖ Managing multiple accounts on services that restrict users\n‚úÖ Avoiding IP bans (though account/device bans still apply)\nProxy vs VPN: Key Differences For average users, proxies and VPNs seem similar, but critical differences exist:\nFeature Proxy VPN Encryption ‚ùå No ‚úÖ Yes Speed ‚ö° Faster üê¢ Slower Anonymity Basic Strong Data Security Minimal High Practical Tip: For simple geo-unblocking, a proxy suffices. For sensitive activities, always choose a VPN.\nReverse Proxies: The Invisible Protectors Reverse proxies work opposite regular proxies - they protect servers rather than clients. They\u0026rsquo;re essential for:\nDDoS protection Firewalling incoming traffic Load balancing across servers Final Advice Remember: hiding your IP doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you completely anonymous online. Tracking methods like cookies, browser fingerprinting, and behavioral analysis can still identify you.\nProxies are useful tools, especially for bypassing geographical restrictions. But for strong security and complete encryption, VPNs remain the gold standard.\nHave you used proxy servers before? Share your experiences in the comments!

  "content":"Windows File Explorer has been the default file management tool for millions of users for decades. While it is a reliable and familiar tool, it lacks many modern features that power users need.\nOver the years, Microsoft has added some improvements, such as dark mode and tabbed browsing, but many essential tools are still missing. After years of struggling with these limitations, I discovered OneCommander, a third-party file manager that solved all my file management problems. In this article, I‚Äôll share why I made the switch and how OneCommander addressed all my frustrations with File Explorer.\nWhy I Left Windows File Explorer Lack of Essential Features Despite its longevity, Windows File Explorer lags behind in several key areas:\nNo folder sizes by default ‚Äì Microsoft claims this is due to performance issues. No dual-pane browsing ‚Äì Comparing files or moving them between folders is cumbersome. Limited customization ‚Äì Users can‚Äôt deeply customize the interface or behavior. No quick file age preview ‚Äì It‚Äôs hard to tell when a file was last modified without opening its properties. These shortcomings make managing large amounts of data inefficient and frustrating. While temporary fixes exist (like using Windhawk to display folder sizes), they are often clunky and unsupported.\nPerformance and Support Issues File Explorer doesn‚Äôt always run smoothly on low-spec devices, and since it‚Äôs built into Windows, there‚Äôs no dedicated support team to address user feedback or quickly fix bugs. Third-party tools like OneCommander, however, are often developed by passionate developers or small teams that actively respond to user needs.\nWhat Makes OneCommander Special? After trying several alternatives‚Äîincluding feature-rich but expensive options like File Pilot‚ÄîI settled on OneCommander, a free, fast, and highly customizable file manager that delivers everything I wanted from File Explorer.\nFast Performance and Modern Interface OneCommander launches faster than File Explorer and uses fewer system resources. It consumes only 2% CPU on startup (compared to File Explorer‚Äôs 5%), making it ideal for older machines. Its sleek, responsive interface feels more modern and polished than File Explorer‚Äôs dated design.\nFolder Sizes Displayed by Default Unlike File Explorer, OneCommander shows folder sizes by default, eliminating the need for external add-ons or workarounds.\nDual-Pane Browsing for Efficient File Management OneCommander offers two types of dual-pane layouts:\nStandard Dual-Pane ‚Äì Displays folders side by side for easy comparison.\nColumn Dual-Pane ‚Äì Navigates using a Mac Finder-like column view.\nThe standard dual-pane layout is especially useful for transferring files between folders or comparing their contents.\nSmart File Age Indicators Instead of raw dates, OneCommander displays file ages relatively (e.g., \u0026ldquo;3 days ago\u0026rdquo;) and uses color-coded tags to indicate recency. This makes it easy to spot recently modified files at a glance.\nAdvanced Organization \u0026amp; Customization Tools Add notes ‚Äì Attach notes inside folders for reminders. Color tagging ‚Äì Assign one of seven colors to folders for visual organization. Color-based search ‚Äì Filter files and folders by their assigned colors. These features make navigating folders with hundreds (or thousands) of items much easier.\nAutomated File Processing OneCommander includes a File Processor with built-in templates for batch renaming and metadata fixes (e.g., MP3 song titles). While advanced features like video-to-MP4 conversion require a $25 Pro license, the free version still offers powerful automation tools.\nExtensive Customization Options From themes and icons to font sizes and animations, OneCommander gives users full control over their experience. These settings are neatly organized in the app‚Äôs configuration menu.\nHow to Set OneCommander as Your Default File Manager OneCommander allows you to set it as the default file manager directly from its settings. You can even bind it to the Win+E shortcut, just like File Explorer.\nThis level of integration is rare among third-party file managers, ensuring a seamless transition away from File Explorer.\nFinal Thoughts Using OneCommander has completely transformed how I manage my files. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and packed with features Microsoft still hasn‚Äôt added to File Explorer. Whether you‚Äôre frustrated by missing folder sizes, lack of customization, or sluggish performance, OneCommander is a compelling alternative.\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a smarter, more efficient way to manage files on Windows, give OneCommander a try. The best part? It‚Äôs completely free.\nFound this article helpful?

  "content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re preparing for a networking, Linux administration, DevOps, or cybersecurity job interview, understanding network ports is crucial. Port numbers are fundamental to network communications, and interviewers frequently test candidates on common ports, their associated protocols, and the security implications of open ports.\nThis guide covers 25 critical network ports you should master. We\u0026rsquo;ll explain their purpose, related protocols, and why they matter in technical interviews. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner or a professional brushing up on fundamentals, this structured reference will help you confidently navigate port-related questions.\nWhat Are Network Ports? Before diving into our list, let\u0026rsquo;s clarify what a network port is.\nA port is a virtual channel enabling communication between computers. Think of it like a hotel room number:\nThe IP address is the hotel\u0026rsquo;s street address The port number specifies which service/application should receive the network request Ports fall into three main ranges:\n‚úÖ 0-1023 ‚Üí Well-known ports (used by system services)\n‚úÖ 1024-49151 ‚Üí Registered ports (used by applications)\n‚úÖ 49152-65535 ‚Üí Dynamic/private ports (temporary connections)\nKnowing key ports and their services is essential for troubleshooting, security management, and network optimization.\nWhy Interviewers Ask About Ports Port-related questions assess your understanding of:\n‚úÖ Services running on different ports\n‚úÖ Differences between TCP and UDP protocols\n‚úÖ Network troubleshooting methodologies\n‚úÖ Security risks of open ports\nCommon interview questions include:\nWhich port does SSH use? How would you check open ports on Linux? What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between ports 80 and 443? Top 25 Network Ports to Memorize Here\u0026rsquo;s the definitive list of 25 essential ports with their protocols and purposes:\nPort Protocol Service Purpose 20 TCP FTP (Data) File transfers (active mode) 21 TCP FTP (Control) FTP command channel 22 TCP SSH Secure remote access/file transfer 23 TCP Telnet Unsecure remote login (legacy) 25 TCP SMTP Email sending 53 TCP/UDP DNS Domain name resolution 67 UDP DHCP Server IP address assignment 68 UDP DHCP Client Receives network configuration 80 TCP HTTP Unencrypted web traffic 110 TCP POP3 Legacy email retrieval 123 UDP NTP Network time synchronization 135 TCP RPC Windows service communication 137 UDP NetBIOS Windows name resolution 138 UDP NetBIOS Network browsing (Windows) 139 TCP NetBIOS Legacy Windows file sharing 143 TCP IMAP Modern email retrieval 161 UDP SNMP Network device monitoring 389 TCP/UDP LDAP Centralized authentication 443 TCP HTTPS Encrypted web traffic 445 TCP SMB Modern Windows file sharing 465 TCP SMTPS Secure email (legacy) 514 UDP Syslog Centralized logging 993 TCP IMAPS Secure IMAP 995 TCP POP3S Secure POP3 3306 TCP MySQL Database service 5432 TCP PostgreSQL Open-source database 5900 TCP VNC Remote desktop access 6379 TCP Redis In-memory data store 8080 TCP HTTP Alt Application servers 8443 TCP HTTPS Alt Custom web apps üí° Quick Tip: Prioritize memorizing:\n‚úÖ 20/21 for FTP\n‚úÖ 22 for SSH\n‚úÖ 80 for HTTP\n‚úÖ 443 for HTTPS\nHow to Check Open Ports in Linux Use these three methods to identify open ports:\n1. Using ss (Modern \u0026amp; Fast) sudo ss -tulpn üìå Flags Explained:\n-t: Show TCP ports -u: Show UDP ports -l: List listening ports only -p: Display process using port -n: Show numeric port numbers 2. Using netstat (Legacy Tool) sudo netstat -tulpn üìå Note: Older systems may require this instead of ss.\n3. Port Scanning with nmap nmap -sT localhost üìå Flags Explained:\n-sT: TCP connect scan localhost: Scan local machine Security Best Practices Open ports create attack surfaces. Secure your system with:\n‚úÖ Close unused ports - Disable unnecessary services\n‚úÖ Implement firewalls - Use ufw or firewalld to restrict access\n‚úÖ Harden exposed services - Enforce encryption for SSH/HTTPS\nExample: Block Port 23 (Telnet) using ufw:\nsudo ufw deny 23 Or with firewalld:\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=23/tcp --permanent Conclusion Mastering these 25 essential ports will boost your networking knowledge and interview performance. Understanding port functions helps troubleshoot issues, secure systems, and optimize network configurations.\nüí¨ Which ports give you the most trouble in real-world scenarios?

  "content":"Have you ever tried to shut down or restart your Windows 11 PC, only to return and find it still running with an error message saying \u0026ldquo;This app is preventing shutdown\u0026rdquo;? If you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered this frustrating situation, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone.\nThis occurs because Windows 11 includes a security feature that blocks shutdown when there are open apps with unsaved data. While designed to prevent data loss, this behavior proves annoying for many users‚Äîespecially when there\u0026rsquo;s nothing important that actually needs saving.\nIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll explain why this error happens and show you an easy way to bypass this behavior, allowing you to shut down your PC without manual intervention.\nWhy Does Windows 11 Block Shutdown? When attempting to shut down, Windows 11 scans all open apps to check for unsaved data. If it detects any application that hasn\u0026rsquo;t fully closed, it halts the shutdown process and displays:\n\u0026ldquo;This app is preventing shutdown.\u0026rdquo;\nEven if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any files open that need saving, this message may appear due to:\nUnknown background processes like MKSInvisibleWindow Apps running that don\u0026rsquo;t require saving (e.g., Notepad) System services that haven\u0026rsquo;t fully terminated In these cases, you must either close the app manually or click \u0026ldquo;Shut down anyway\u0026rdquo; to force Windows 11 to complete the shutdown.\nHow to Stop Apps from Blocking Windows 11 Shutdown To fix this, you can make a simple Registry tweak that forces Windows to automatically close apps during shutdown.\nStep 1: Open Registry Editor (Regedit) Press the Search button on the taskbar and type regedit. Open Registry Editor and click \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; when prompted for admin access. Step 2: Modify Registry Settings Navigate to this path:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop In the right panel, create a new String Value named AutoEndTasks (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist):\nRight-click ‚Üí New ‚Üí String Value. Rename the new value to AutoEndTasks. Set AutoEndTasks to 1:\nDouble-click AutoEndTasks, enter 1, then save.\nStep 3: Speed Up Shutdown To make shutdown faster and more efficient, add these values under the same path:\nWaitToKillAppTimeout ‚Üí Set to 2000 (2 seconds instead of 20). HungAppTimeout ‚Üí Reduce from 5000 to 2000. Step 4: Adjust System Settings Navigate to:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control Find WaitToKillServiceTimeout. Set it to 2000 (instead of 5000). Step 5: Apply Changes Close Registry Editor. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect. With these tweaks, Windows 11 will shut down automatically without requiring manual input. However, always save your work before shutting down, as the system will no longer check for unsaved data before closing apps.\nDid this method help you?

  "content":"That new computer smell is intoxicating, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? The sleek design, the promise of speed\u0026hellip; until you power it on and realize it\u0026rsquo;s bloated with pre-installed software you\u0026rsquo;ll never use and lacking essential tools to make your digital life smoother. After years of this cycle, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a core set of must-have free Windows apps that instantly make any new machine feel like my own. Without these, my PC feels incomplete.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re setting up a new Windows computer, here are the first five apps I always download:\n1. IObit Uninstaller One of my first tasks with a fresh Windows install is tackling unwanted bloatware‚Äîthose unnecessary apps manufacturers (or even Windows itself) pre-install. Manually removing them is tedious, which is why I rely on IObit Uninstaller. This utility lists all installed programs clearly, letting you check boxes next to unwanted apps and click \u0026ldquo;Uninstall.\u0026rdquo;\nBut IObit isn\u0026rsquo;t just for initial cleanup‚Äîit\u0026rsquo;s essential for ongoing maintenance. It helps:\n‚úî Remove bundled software (those sneaky apps installed alongside others)\n‚úî Uninstall large or rarely used programs to reclaim disk space\n‚úî Manage and remove browser extensions from one interface\n‚úî Clean leftover files after uninstalling\n‚úî Update outdated software\n‚úî Block annoying pop-up notifications\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive system tool that keeps your PC lean and clean.\nDownload IObit Uninstaller\n2. Everything Windows\u0026rsquo; built-in search has always frustrated me‚Äîit\u0026rsquo;s slow and often fails to find files I know exist. Everything solves this perfectly. It delivers lightning-fast file searches, filtering results instantly as you type. You can:\nüîç Exclude specific folders from searches\nüìå Bookmark frequent search queries\nüéØ Use advanced filters and operators\nüìÑ Even search for text inside files\nIf you rely on Windows\u0026rsquo; default search, switching to Everything will feel revolutionary.\nDownload Everything\n3. Screenpresso While Windows\u0026rsquo; Snipping Tool has its uses, Screenpresso is my go-to for efficient screenshots and annotations. It lets you capture:\nüñ•Ô∏è Full screens\nü™ü Specific windows\nüìè Custom regions\nüåê Scrolling web pages\nIts built-in editor saves me tons of time when creating tutorials or documenting issues. I can easily add arrows, numbered steps, text boxes, and blur sensitive info. Every screenshot auto-saves to a history log for quick retrieval later.\nSharing is seamless too‚Äîupload directly to Google Drive, Dropbox, or email with one click.\nDownload Screenpresso\n4. Brave Browser Though Microsoft Edge has improved, Brave remains my daily browser for its privacy-first approach:\nüõ°Ô∏è Blocks ads \u0026amp; trackers by default\nüîí Strong protection against cookies and fingerprinting\nüåê Includes Tor private windows for extra anonymity\nüí∞ Built-in crypto wallet and VPN options\nYou get faster page loads and enhanced security without installing separate ad blockers or privacy extensions.\nDownload Brave\n5. VLC Media Player No Windows setup is complete without VLC. This powerhouse plays virtually any media format flawlessly‚Äîfrom common MP4s to obscure FLAC and MKV files. Bonus features include:\nüé¨ Screen and webcam recording\nüìù Manual subtitle syncing\nüîÑ File format conversion\nüé® Custom skins and interfaces\nBest of all, it\u0026rsquo;s completely ad-free and open-source.\nDownload VLC\nFinal Thoughts These five free apps transform any new Windows PC into an efficient, personalized workstation. They help me:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove bloatware\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Find files instantly\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Capture and annotate screens\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Browse securely\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Play any media\nWhat are your must-install apps for a new PC?

  "content":"With the launch of One UI 7, millions of Samsung fans are experiencing the vertical app drawer for the first time‚Äîa feature other Android phones have had for nearly a decade. Yet this simple change has become one of the most praised aspects of the update. Should you make the switch?\nLet‚Äôs explore why this new layout might convince you to abandon the traditional horizontal app drawer if you haven‚Äôt already.\nFewer Swipes to Reach Your Favorite Apps We unlock our phones hundreds of times a day. While we might not open the app drawer every time, doing so becomes significantly faster with a vertical layout.\nWith horizontal app pages, accessing most apps requires multiple swipes‚Äîapps on the first page are quick to reach, but those on later pages demand extra effort. The more apps you install, the longer it takes to reach those at the end. (Ever tried finding an app in a drawer with nine pages of apps?)\nA vertical app drawer changes everything. Every app is just two gestures away:\nSwipe up to open the drawer. Scroll vertically to your desired app. Thanks to inertial scrolling, icons move as fast as you flick your thumb. After a few uses, muscle memory kicks in, making navigation effortless.\nInstant Alphabetical Navigation Fast scrolling is only part of the story. Like Niagara Launcher (a fan-favorite vertical launcher), Samsung‚Äôs new drawer lets you jump to any letter in the alphabet.\nSimply drag your thumb slowly along the side of the screen‚Äîas you hover over a letter, the app list instantly snaps to that section. No more guessing which page an app is on!\nVertical Scrolling Feels More Natural Personally, I find vertical thumb movement far more comfortable than horizontal swiping. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîsideways gestures (like Android‚Äôs back swipe) aren‚Äôt painful, but repetitive horizontal scrolling feels awkward.\nThis is why I prefer vertical scrolling in e-readers over page-turning animations. Decades ago, websites experimented with horizontal layouts, but vertical scrolling won. We‚Äôre all trained for it. So why should app drawers be any different?\nA Seamless Extension of Your Home Screen The vertical drawer isn‚Äôt just intuitive‚Äîit extends your home screen‚Äôs natural motion. Swipe up to see your docked apps, then continue the same gesture to reveal the full app list. No jarring transitions.\nThis refinement is so satisfying that it‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôve stuck with Samsung‚Äôs One UI over third-party launchers.\nFinal Thoughts Samsung‚Äôs vertical app drawer is a small change with big usability benefits:\n‚úÖ Faster access to all apps\n‚úÖ Alphabetical jumping for precision\n‚úÖ Ergonomic scrolling that feels natural\nWhat do you think? Is the vertical app drawer a welcome upgrade, or do you prefer the old horizontal style? Share your thoughts in the comments!
